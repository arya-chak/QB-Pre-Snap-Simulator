# QB-Pre-Snap-Simulator
A simulator/tester for quarterbacks to see if they can call the correct play based on what the defense gives them pre-snap.

Will be adding:
1. X's and O's visuals for offense and defense
2. Mode where you are given 5 plays that could work instead of going through entire playbook
3. Ability to call audible, motions, hot routes, and changes other aspects of the play before snapping the ball
