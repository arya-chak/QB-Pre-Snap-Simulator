"Most quarterbacks aren't playing the game like that anymore. They're fast when they get out of the pocket when they have to make decisions, but I didn't snap the ball unless I knew what they were doing, and if my guys were going to be open. The one benefit you have as a quarterback before you snap the ball, you know where everybody on your team is running." - Tom Brady
